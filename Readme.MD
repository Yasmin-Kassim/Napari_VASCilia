# VASCilia: A Napari Plugin for Cochlear StereoCilia Analysis
Explore the complexities of the cochlea with VASCilia, a Napari plugin created to aid in the 3D segmentation and quantification of stereocilia bundles. Equipped with a range of thoughtful features, VASCilia stands for (Vision Analysis StereoCilia) and it provides a supportive tool for auditory research, including:

46 stacks are manually annotated by Yasmin Kassim and four undergraduate students using CVAT annotation tool: Samia Rahman, Ibraheem Al Shammaa, Samer Salim, and Kevin Huang.

We are working on annotatating more data for adult mice. This dataset will be the first annotated dataset in the literature to 3D segment the stereocilia bundles and it will be published and available for the ear research community with the publication of this paper.
