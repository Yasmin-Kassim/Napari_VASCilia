# VASCilia: A Revolutionary Napari Plugin for Cochlear StereoCilia Analysis
 
 Embark on a groundbreaking journey through the intricacies of the cochlea with VASCilia, the pioneering Napari plugin designed for the 3D segmentation and quantification of stereocilia bundles. Unveiling a suite of powerful features, VASCilia is a beacon of innovation for the auditory research realm, offering:

1. Selective Slice Discovery: Traverse the 3D landscape to pinpoint pivotal slices within your stack.
2. Stack Rotation: Align your perspective with precision for an optimal analytical viewpoint.
3. 3D Instance Segmentation with Multi-Object Assignment algorithm: Distinguish and analyze individual bundles with striking clarity.
4. Delete bundles: delete unwnated bundles.
6. Regional Bundle Categorization: Classify bundles distinctly as BASE, MIDDLE, or APEX regions.
7. IHC vs. OHC Identification: Accurately differentiate between Inner Hair Cells and Outer Hair Cells.
8. Comprehensive Measurement Computation: Determine volumes, centroids, surface areas, and more with precision.
9. Protein Intensity Quantification: Analyze the EPS8 protein with unrivaled accuracy.
10. 3D Distance Mapping: Chart the distance from peak to base for each bundle in three dimensions, tailored to your sample's resolution.

VASCilia stands as a treasure trove for the ear research community, heralding an era of simplicity and comprehensive measurements that resonate with the needs of laboratories worldwide. Alongside the plugin,  present a full-fledged collection of trained models for seamless 3D segmentation and region classification.

Moreover, we champion the advancement of knowledge by offering a dedicated training section. Whether you're delving into alternate staining methods or yearning to annotate, refine, and train new segmentation models.

Join the vanguard of auditory research with VASCiliaâ€”where sophistication meets simplicity.
